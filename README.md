This is an implementation of LandBox algorithms. It has four different game modes. 
1. Tutorial model
2. LandBox
3. Small asteroid
4. Small island
in order to simulate the environmental system as a form of game.

Oh!!, we need to protect these small environments from the disasters and maintain the balance between human activity and environment.
